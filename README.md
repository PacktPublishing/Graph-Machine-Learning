# Graph Machine Learning

<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/graph-machine-learning/9781800204492"><img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781800204492/cover/smaller" height="256px" align="right"></a>

This is the code repository for [Graph Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/product/graph-machine-learning/9781800204492), published by Packt.

**Take graph data to the next level by applying machine learning techniques and algorithms**


## What is this book about?
Graph Machine Learning provides a new set of tools for processing network data and leveraging the power of the relation between entities that can be used for predictive, modeling, and analytics tasks.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Write Python scripts to extract features from graphs
* Distinguish between the main graph representation learning techniques
* Become well-versed with extracting data from social networks, financial transaction systems, and more
* Implement the main unsupervised and supervised graph embedding techniques
* Get to grips with shallow embedding methods, graph neural networks, graph regularization methods, and more

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from stellargraph.mapper import HinSAGENodeGenerator
batch_size = 50
num_samples = [10, 5]
generator = HinSAGENodeGenerator(
 subgraph, batch_size, num_samples,
 head_node_type="document"
)
```

The notebooks in the repositories save files and figures into dedicated folders as they are executed. The format for these folders are:

```
<DATA_FOLDER>/Chapter<n>
```

where `DATA_FOLDER` is an environment variable that you can use to customize the position for the data. If the variable is not set, its value fall back to `<root_folder_repo>/data`.

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data analysts, graph developers, graph analysts, and graph professionals who want to leverage the information embedded in the connections and relations between data points to boost their analysis and model performance. The book will also be useful for data scientists and machine learning developers who want to build ML-driven graph databases. A beginner-level understanding of graph databases and graph data is required. Intermediate-level working knowledge of Python programming and machine learning is also expected to make the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
