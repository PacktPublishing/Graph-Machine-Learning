    "In the code above, we are implementing a GraphSAGE model to perform link prediction on a graph using the Deep Graph Library (DGL) and PyTorch. We start by setting up the computational device and initializing the node features as identity matrices. The graph's edges are then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Negative edges are sampled to serve as negative examples during training. We define a GraphSAGE model with two layers that aggregate neighbor information and a dot-product-based edge predictor to compute edge scores. The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss, optimized with the Adam optimizer. After training for a specified number of epochs, we evaluate the model's performance using common metrics on the test set."
